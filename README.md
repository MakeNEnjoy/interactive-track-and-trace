# Interactive Particle Track and Trace

This project seeks to interactively visualise the motion of particles in the Dutch North Sea to raise awareness about Ocean litter.

Two approaches will be produced and evaluated, to answer the research question: **How does a dedicated interaction-reward scheme impact the engagement with a visual simulation of floating marine debris?**

## Base Interaction Approach

See original proposal for description.

## Gamified Reward Scheme Interaction Approach

The gamified interaction will involve maneuvering a bird character to collect food (green particles) and avoid litter (red particles). Successfully completing this goal will grant the player reward achievements. See below for some example reward achievements.
